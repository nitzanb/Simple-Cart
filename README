Simple Cart plugin for WordPress
===========================

This simple plugin will add a cart functionality to a wordpress installation.
There are few "e-commerce" plugins out there but they are large and bloat,
I've needed something light and simple.

Creating products
-----------------
Each product is actually a post, I'm using a custom field called 'item_price'
in order to set the item price. Either than that - all data comes from the 
post data.


=== RELEASE NOTES ===

simple_cart.php - 	The main plugin file

cart.php - 	The class that manage the cart functionality

			needed post data without new queries
